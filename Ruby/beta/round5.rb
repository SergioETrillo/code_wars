Given an integer as input, can you round it to the next 5?

Examples:

input:    output:
0    ->   0
2    ->   5
3    ->   5
12   ->   15
21   ->   25
30   ->   30
etc.
Input may be any positive or negative integer (including 0).

You can assume that all inputs are valid integers.

  n%5 == 0? n: n + 5 - n%5

#the fanciest, but why double negative??
# wow, thatÂ´s really clever

def round_to_next_5(n)
  -(-n / 5 * 5)
end
